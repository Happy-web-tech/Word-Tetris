I coded this game as a part of my college project. I created a web application called 'Typing Wizard' along with two of my frineds. The application teaches touch typing to the user to improve his typing speed. It had many modules and among them one was the game which aims to teach typing in a fun way. It was fun and a leaning experience for all of us
